Figure 1. Analytical scheme of current study. (A) Using LIFE cohort data, we conducted a multivariate exposome-wide association study (EWAS) to systematically assess the associations between seven semen quality endpoints simultaneously and endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs). (B) Using LIFE cohort data, we conducted a post-hoc power analysis to gauge the sample size requirement for each of the endpoint for future EWAS. (C) We employed the meta-review technique to identify studies investigating the effects of EDC exposure on semen quality that we pooled related outcomes together. We conducted a post-hoc power analysis to assess whether the sample size of existing fecundity and fertility cohorts can produce enough statistical power to drive EWAS.

Figure 2. Illustration of the analytical scheme for the exposome-wide association (EWAS) analysis. The LIFE Study comprises 473 men for whom 128 endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) have been quantified. Missing EDC concentrations were imputed using multiple imputation techniques. All semen quality endpoints, except percent morphologically normal sperm, were log-transformed prior to analysis. For each EDC, we modeled seven semen variables with a multivariate multiple regression, adjusted for a set of five a priori covariates based on chemical class. We did not adjust for lipids or creatinine for per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances, blood metals or cotinine. Then, we combined the F statistic from the imputed data sets and used family-wise error rate to control for type I error adjusted for false discovery.
